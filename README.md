# FR4NKEN
What is FR4NKEN? To first cover what FR4NKEN is, we first must cover what
FR4NKEN isn't. FR4NKEN is not a useful piece of software for anyone. FR4NKEN is
not trying to be a useful piece of software. Neither is FR4NKEN trying to be
practical, or well designed. Other than those things, FR4NKEN is attempting to
be everything else. Have you thought of a feature? FR4NKEN wants to have it. Two
different, incompatible features that make 0 sense to have in a single program?
Throw them in together! What's the worst that will happen?

Oh yeah, and this extends to languages too! FR4NKEN isn't a boring piece of
software written in just one programming language, here we are inclusive! Every
language deserves a seat at the table (or more precisely, a folder in `src`).
Like a language but don't see it present? Send a patch with some extra features
written in that language, connecting it to the rest of the program with whatever
eldritch code you need!

# Roadmap
FR4NKEN doesn't really do anything yet (the opposite of its goal). Here's the
current roadmap:
* Get basic infrastructure (currently in C, C++, and Zig) up to allow the
  language soup to form. [Done]
* Create an event-driven system using the OOP system. [Done]
* Get SDL graphics working
* Make some ~~utterly bizarre~~ "unique" UI with the graphics.
* Make some more UI elements, throwing in some other languages while doing it
* Make the entire rest of the universe
