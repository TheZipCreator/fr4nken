# FR4NKEN
What is FR4NKEN? To first cover what FR4NKEN is, we first must cover what
FR4NKEN isn't. FR4NKEN is not a useful piece of software for anyone FR4NKEN is
not trying to be a useful piece of software. FR4NKEN is trying to be fun. Other
than those things, FR4NKEN is attempting to be everything else. Think of a
feature? FR4NKEN wants to have it. Two different, incompatible features that
make 0 sense to have in a single program? Throw them in together! What's the
worst that will happen?

Oh yeah, and this extends to languages to! FR4NKEN isn't a boring piece of
software written in just one programming language, here we are inclusive! Every
language deserves a seat at the table (or more precisely, a folder in `src`).
Like a language but don't see it present? Send a patch with some extra features
written in that language, connecting it to the rest of the program with whatever
eldritch code you need!
